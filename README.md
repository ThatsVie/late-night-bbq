# ðŸ”¥ Late Night BBQ â€” Website & Admin Dashboard

## Purpose

To build a beautiful, accessible, bilingual website for a small BBQ delivery business in Houston. It will:

- Help users place orders, and leave reviews
- Give admins a dashboard to manage users, track orders, and view metrics
- Reflect the warmth, connection, and reputation the couple has built in their community

---

## Core Sections

### 1. Public Website

- Homepage
- About the business / couple
- Testimonials
- Storefront (Order / Merch options)
- Booking calendar (embed or custom)

**How:** Built with React + TypeScript, deployed on Vercel  
**Why:** Fast, responsive, accessible, bilingual â€” all publicly visible and mobile-friendly

---

### 2. Authentication

- Create account (name, email, phone, password)
- Email verification
- 2-step authentication (via email or phone)
- Login / logout
- Role: user vs admin

**How:** Use Firebase Auth  
**Why:** Secure, easy to integrate, handles 2FA, and reduces need to manage passwords manually

---

### 3. User-Specific Functionality (after login)

- Place an order (submit form + pay with Stripe)
- Leave a review / testimonial
- View order history
- Profile management

**How:** React UI + serverless API routes on Vercel, connected to PostgreSQL + Stripe  
**Why:** Allows users to interact meaningfully while keeping sensitive actions behind auth

---

### 4. Admin Dashboard

- View all orders and filter/search
- View and manage user data
- View submitted reviews
- Access metrics (site visits, order stats, revenue)
- Possibly export data or manage booking schedule

**How:** Protected admin route in React app + backend API endpoints  
**Why:** Enables the couple to manage the business without needing external tools

## Security & Privacy

- All sensitive actions (place order, leave review, view dashboard) require authentication
- Firebase ensures email is verified and 2FA is used
- Backend serverless functions verify Firebase tokens before interacting with the database
- Stripe handles all payment data â€” no card data touches your server
- Role-based routing and API protection ensures only admins can access dashboard content
