**Late Night BBQ** is a modern, bilingual content-managed website and admin dashboard built for a beloved BBQ catering business in Houston, Texas. Our mission was to honor their story while giving them full ownership over their digital presence.

## We designed and built a people-first, tech-forward solution that:

- Lets the business showcase their menu, merch, story, and community love
- Allows customers to explore the business in English or Spanish
- Supports secure content editing through a custom-built admin dashboard
- Shares authentic community voices through testimonials
- Delivers a fast, accessible, and scalable experience with modern tools

**This project empowers the business to:**
- Update homepage banners, menu items, testimonials, about page content, and merch directly
- Receive order requests through a dynamic contact form linked via Resend

**And it lets visitors:**
- Navigate a warm, modern site in English or Spanish
- Explore the story, food, and love behind the business

Built with **Next.js**, **Firebase**, and **Vercel**, this app reflects both the soul of the brand and the strength of modern web technology.
