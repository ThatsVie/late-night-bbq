      "p1": "Late Night BBQ began as a labor of love between two people who simply loved to cook and connect. What started with late-night ribs and brisket for family and neighbors grew into something bigger.",
      "p2": "Without a storefront or marketing, word of mouth spread. Orders came in for celebrations, baby showers, and 'just because' weekends. Every delivery came with a side of joy and connection.",
      "p3": "Now, we’re excited to share our BBQ with more of Houston, still made the same way: slow, tender, and from the heart."
